# Semver

A Swift package for parsing semantic versioning. This is a binding to [semver](https://docs.rs/semver/latest/semver/index.html).

It parses Cargo's flavor of semantic versioning. See [semver's README](https://github.com/dtolnay/semver/blob/master/README.md#scope-of-this-crate) for more information.

Bridge between Rust and Swift generated using [Swift Bridge](https://github.com/chinedufn/swift-bridge).
